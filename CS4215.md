# A Lazy Basic Block Versioning Interpreter for CPython.

# Build instructions

You should follow the official CPython build instructions for your platform.

We have one major difference - you must have a pre-existing Python installation.
Preferrably Python 3.9 or higher. On MacOS/Unix systems, that Python installation
*must* be located at `python3`.

The main reason for this limitation is that Python is used to bootstrap the compilation
of Python. However, since our interpreter is unable to run a large part of the Python
language, our interpreter cannot be used as a bootstrap Python.


# Where are files located?

The majority of the changes and functionality are in `Python/tier2.c`. Doxygen documentation
is written alongside the code.
