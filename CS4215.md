# A Lazy Basic Block Versioning Interpreter for CPython.

# Build instructions

You should follow the official CPython build instructions for your platform.

We have one major difference - you must have a pre-existing Python installation.
Preferrably Python 3.9 or higher. On MacOS/Unix systems, that Python installation
*must* be located at `python3`.

The main reason for this limitation is that Python is used to bootstrap the compilation
of Python. However, since our interpreter is unable to run a large part of the Python
language, our interpreter cannot be used as a bootstrap Python.


# Where are files located?

The majority of the changes and functionality are in `Python/tier2.c` where Doxygen documentation
is written alongside the code, and in `Tools/cases_generator/` which contains the DSL implementation.

# Running tests

We've written simple tests of the main functionalities.
Unfortunately we did not have time to write comprehensive tests, and it doesn't seem worth it eitherways given the experimental nature of this project.

After building, run `python tier2_test.py` in the repository's root folder.

# Debugging output

In `tier2.c`, two flags can be set to print debug messages:
```c
// Prints codegen debug messages
#define BB_DEBUG 0

// Prints typeprop debug messages
#define TYPEPROP_DEBUG 0
```
